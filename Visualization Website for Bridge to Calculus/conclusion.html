            <p>In this project, we successfully collected, curated, and visualized the data related to MCAS and NAEP math scores. After meetings with Professor Raj of Bridge To Calculus,
              we identified the client needs and constructed our <a href="task-analysis.html">Task Analysis</a>. </p>
              <p>It was discussed that simplicity was desirable. By visualizing using only line charts and bar charts, we respected this.</p>
              <p> However, we did not let that mean our work had to be simple overall. In fact, we drove insight through the interactive features we implemented.</p>
              <p> For example, we implemented a slider which would plot a grouped bar chart of the scores for that particular year. This allows users to focus in on comparisons within a particular 
                year more easily. The slider also has a "timeline" effect, so by sliding you are essentially painting a story of the scores over time; exactly what we were asked to do!</p>
                <p>Another example of how we drove insight with interactivity was through our linking. We linked the hovering features of both MCAS line charts so that a hover on one graph produced
                  the hovering effect for the corresponding point on the other graph. This was our way of driving the user to think about differences between grades, while also being able to visualize
                  how those differences change over time.</p>

                  <h1>Improvements</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                  <p>To improve our visualization, we would like to drive more insight through interactivity.</p>

                  <p>An idea we suggested was to implement a linking between the bar chart and line chart. This produces a very powerful effect on the user.</p>

                  <p>This link would be such that whichever year the slider is on, those dots would receive a hovering request and display their information.</p>

                  <p> Hovering over a certain bar would also link to the line charts via a hovering effect.</p>

                  <p> We would also like to improve the under the hood code. The code driving this whole visualization is more complex than it needs to be, and needs to implement
                    the single point of change principle more effectively. With more time, this is an area we would definitely focus on.
